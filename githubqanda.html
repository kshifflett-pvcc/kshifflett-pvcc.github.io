    <td>What is a version control system?</td>
    <td> Version control is like a savings program for your project. By tracking and logging the changes you make to your file or file sets over time, a version-control system gives you the power to review or even restore earlier versions. Version control takes snapshots of every revision to your project. You can then access these versions to compare or restore them as needed.</td></tr>
    <td>What is Git?</td>
    <td> Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</td></tr>
    <td>What is the difference between Git and Github?</td>
    <td> Github is an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer/server. Git is the content, Github <i>hosts</i> the content. </td></tr>
    <td>Who started Github and how was it started? </td>
    <td> GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008.</td></tr>
    <td>What company owns it now?</td>
    <td> Microsoft acquired Github on June 4th, 2018.</td></tr>
    <td>What is Octocat?</td>
    <td> Octocat is the mascot of the source-code hosting service GitHub.</td></tr>

<b><td>Workflows:</b></td><td> A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.</td></tr>
<b><td>Issues:</b></td><td> Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators.</td></tr>
