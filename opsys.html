        <br>
        <td><b>Operating System:</b></td><td>Alternatively called an OS, is software installed on a computer's hard drive that enables the computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software. Without a computer operating system, a computer and software programs would be useless.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Job Queue:</b></td><td>The software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>FIFO:</b></td><td>Short for first in, first out, FIFO is a method of processing data where the data first received is the first to be sent out after processed.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Interactive processing:</b></td><td>In computer science, interactive computing refers to software which accepts input from the user as it runs.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Time-sharing:</b></td><td>Sharing of a computing resource among many users at the same time by means of multiprogramming and multi-tasking.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Multiprogramming:</b></td><td>The running of two or more programs or sequences of instructions simultaneously by a computer with more than one central processor.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Application software:</b></td><td>A type of computer program that performs a specific personal, educational, and business function. Each application is designed to assist users in accomplishing a variety of tasks, which may be related to productivity, creativity, or communication.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>System software:</b></td><td>A program designed to run a computer's hardware and applications and manage its resources, such as its memory, processors, and devices. It also provides a platform for running application software, and system software is typically bundled with a computer's operating system.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Utility software:</b></td><td>All systems and programs on a computer system that maintain its functionality. A computer's utility software includes components that assist the operating system to optimize, maintain, organize and manage how it functions in all situations.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</b></td><td>A GUI uses windows, icons, and menus to carry out commands, such as opening, deleting, and moving files.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Shell:</b></td><td>Your interface to the operating system is called a shell. The shell is the outermost layer of the operating system. Shells incorporate a programming language to control processes and files, as well as to start and control other programs.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Kernel:</b></td><td>The kernel is a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface between the computer's physical hardware and the processes running on it. The kernel enables multiple applications to share hardware resources by providing access to CPU, memory, disk I/O, and networking.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Device driver:</b></td><td>A device driver is a special kind of software program that controls a specific hardware device attached to a computer. Device drivers are essential for a computer to work properly.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>File manager:</b></td><td>A file manager is a software program that helps a user manage all the files on their computer. For example, all file managers allow the user to view, edit, copy, and delete the files on their computer storage devices.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Memory manager:</b></td><td>A memory manager is a software utility that operates in conjunction with the operating system. It helps manage memory more efficiently and provides additional features such as flushing out unused segments of memory. All modern operating systems provide memory management.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Virtual memory:</b></td><td>Virtual memory is a method of using the computer hard drive to provide extra memory for the computer. Segments of memory are stored on the hard drive known as pages. When a segment of memory is requested that is stored in virtual memory, it is loaded into the actual memory address.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Boot strapping:</b></td><td>Is a program that resides in the computer's EPROM, ROM, or another non-volatile memory. It is automatically executed by the processor when turning on the computer. The bootstrap loader reads the hard drives boot sector to continue to load the computer's operating system.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>ROM:</b></td><td>Short for read-only memory, ROM is a storage medium that is used with computers and other electronic devices. As the name indicates, data stored in ROM may only be read. It is either modified with extreme difficulty or not at all.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Deadlock:</b></td><td>When two programs are waiting for the same signal from each other, they are said to be at a deadlock.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Spooling:</b></td><td>Placing data into an intermediate storage area, where it's held until the computer or user is ready to process it. This storage area is called a spool. Most computers have print spools, for example, which hold printing jobs that are waiting to be printed.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Super user (or Administrator):</b></td><td>Alternatively called an admin, administrator, and gatekeeper, root is a superuser account on a computer or network and has complete control.<br></td></tr>
        <td><b>Mutli-Factor authentication:</b></td><td>Is a digital security system that uses several security methods to secure your account on a service. For example, one could use a combination of password, biometrics, or cellphone/e-mail verification codes to log in to the service. MFA gives your account an additional layer of protection in case someone were to get your username and password to your account.<br></td></tr>
