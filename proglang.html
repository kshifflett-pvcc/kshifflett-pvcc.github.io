            <td><b>Machine language:</b></td><td>Machine language is the language understood by a computer. It is very difficult to understand, but it is the only thing that the computer can work with. All programs and programming languages eventually generate or run programs in machine language.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Debugging:</b></td><td>the process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Assembler:</b></td><td>a program for converting instructions written in low-level symbolic code into machine code.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Assembly language:</b></td><td>is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Translator:</b></td><td>A translator or programming language processor is a generic term that can refer to a compiler, assembler, or interpreterâ€”anything that converts code from one computer language into another.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Compiler:</b></td><td>A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Interpreter:</b></td><td>An interpreter translates source code into object code one instruction at a time.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Cross-platform software:</b></td><td>The cross-platform or multiplatform software is a type of application / program / software that works on various operating systems or devices, which are often called platforms. A platform means an operating system such as Windows, Mac OS, Android, or iOS.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Natural language:</b></td>Includes speech and text.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Formal language:</b></td><td>A formal language is an abstract language used to express definitions, instructions and logic. It consists of a certain set of character or symbol chains (words), which in turn are formed from certain characters (alphabet, symbols).</td></tr>
            <td><b>Machine independence:</b></td><td>A term applied to software that is not dependent on the properties of a particular machine, and can therefore be used on any machine. Such software is also described as portable.</td></tr>
            <td><b>High-level programming language:</b></td><td>is a programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Object-oriented programming (OOP):</b></td><td>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Scripting language:</b></td><td>A scripting language is a programming language that is interpreted. It is translated into machine code when the code is run, rather than beforehand. Scripting languages are often used for short scripts over full computer programs. JavaScript, Python, and Ruby are all examples of scripting languages.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Data types:</b><td></td></tr>
                <td><b>Integer:</b></td><td>Integers are numbers without a fractional component, and don't support decimal points.</td></tr>
                <td><b>Float:</b></td><td>Floating point numbers are decimal values or fractional numbers like 22.5, 10.67, 90.46.</td></tr>
                <td><b>String:</b></td><td>String is a sequence of characters used to represent text.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Primitive data type:</b></td><td>A set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor, which all compiled programs must use.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Data structure:</b></td><td>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.</td></tr>
            <td><b>PYTHON collection data structures:</b><td></td></tr>
                <td><b>List:</b></td><td>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are created using square brackets.</td></tr>
                <td><b>Tuple:</b></td><td>A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are written with round brackets.</td></tr>
                <td><b>Set:</b></td><td>td>A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed. Sets are written with curly brackets.</td></tr>
                <td><b>Dictionary:</b></td><td>A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Function:</b></td><td>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Local variable:</b></td><td>Variables that are created inside of a function are known as local variables.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Global variable:</b></td><td>Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Source program:</b></td><td>A program written in a language other than machine code, typically a high-level language.</td></tr>
            <td><b>Object program:</b></td><td>A program into which some other program is translated by an assembler or compiler.</td></tr>
