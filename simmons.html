<h2><i>Roper v. Simmons</i></h2>
<h3>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
<i>Roper v. Simmons</i> is a case brought before the United States Supreme Court in which 5 out of 9 Justices voted in favor of abolishing the death penalty for capital crimes committed by children under 18 years of age.
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
At just 17 years old, Christopher Simmons and an accomplice broke into 43-year-old Shirley Crook’s home. Because Mrs. Crook was home during the crime and witnessed the young thieves, burglary turned to murder. Simmons covered Mrs. Crook’s face with a towel and duct tape and bound her hands and feet with electrical wire. While bound, Mrs. Crook was thrown over a bridge and she drowned in the Meramec River in Missouri. Upon conviction, Simmons was sentenced to death for the murder of Mrs. Shirley Crook.
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
Prior to <i>Roper v. Simmons</i>, the precedent for the execution of minors was set in <i>Stanford v. Kentucky</i>. <i>Stanford v. Kentucky</i> was decided in 1989 and states that the execution of 16- and 17-year-old offenders was not constitutionally barred and was permissible in states such as Missouri.
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
Simmon’s defense appealed against the death penalty. Upon reaching the Supreme Court, experts in psychology, sociology, and adolescent development testified to the court that developmental milestones responsible for decision-making, impulsivity, and risk-taking are not reached at 16 or 17 years of age, hence assailants in this age range have a reduced capacity for reasoning and judgement. 
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
Justice Kennedy delivers the 5-4 opinion in March of 2005, stating “When a juvenile offender commits a heinous crime, the state can exact forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties, but the state cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity.” The Supreme Court ruled that sentencing minors to death violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Justice Kennedy continues, “From a moral standpoint, it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for greater possibility exists that a minor’s character deficiencies will be reformed.”
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
Justice O’Connor dissented with the majority opinion, criticizing the Missouri Supreme Court for failing to adhere to the precedent established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Stanford v. Kentucky. O’Connor suggests that the difference in maturity between adults and juveniles was neither universal nor significant enough to justify a rule excluding juveniles from the death penalty, despite scientific evidence suggesting to the contrary.
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
The American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry concurs with the ruling, commenting “[This ruling] does not excuse violent criminal behavior, but it’s an important factor for courts to consider when wielding a punishment as extreme and irreversible as death.” The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly forbid the execution of offenders who were under the age of 18 at the time of their offenses of which they were convicted.
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Ginsburg, added “Perhaps even more important than our specific holding today is our reaffirmation of the basic principle that informs the Court’s interpretation of the Eighth Amendment. If the meaning of the Amendment had been frozen when it was originally drafted, it would impose no impediment on the execution of 7-year-old children.”
